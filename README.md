The goal of this project is to highlight a few good patterns for creating nodejs
projects.  This project should be easy to setup for new developers and highlight
some cool tools and tricks for working on node projects.

Once you have the above installed you can then run:

```
> vagrant up
```
in the project folder.  This will setup everything you need to run this project.

- `npm start` starts this project running on http://localhost:3000
- `npm stop` stops this project 
- `npm restart` restarts the project and loads any new changes made
- `npm test` run the unit tests
- `npm run lint` check the code for common style errors
